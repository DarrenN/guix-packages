* Guix Packages

Personal Guix Packages - https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/Packaging-Tutorial.html

Mostly Common Lisp and Scheme packages not available in the usual Guix channels.

** 📂 Contents

| Package | URL                            | Install                                       |
|---------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ICL     | https://github.com/atgreen/icl | =guix install -L <repo-path/guix-packages> icl= |

** 🧰 Usage

If you want to install as a local channel, then add something like to your =channels.scm=:

#+begin_src scheme
(channel
 (name 'guix-packages)
 (url "file:///<local-path>/guix-packages")
 (branch "main"))
#+end_src

** 🤖 AI at Work

I make heavy use of agents to generate these packages. This is exactly the kind of toil that AI/LLMs are good for. If you have a philosophical issue with this please feel free to hand-roll your own packages elsewhere. Thank you! 🙇🏼‍♂️
